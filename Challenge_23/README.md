# Flag 22 - Receive pending intent

## Solution 

This lab same as the previous but now we are the receiver for `pending-intent` not creator 

## Key Concepts

1. A PendingIntent executes with the creator app’s permissions, not the receiver’s.

2. Implicit intents can be intercepted by any app with a matching intent-filter.
